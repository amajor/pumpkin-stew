        <h3>WHEN</h3>
        <p>We've pretty much decided that the first Saturday of November is the magic day every year.</p>
        <p>Next magic day:</p>
        <blockquote>November 2, 2013<br/>4:00pm - 9:00pm EST</blockquote>

        <h3>WHAT</h3>
        <p>We've got a little bit of an earlier start time for those with kiddos that want to come but don't want to sacrifice bedtime. But really, it's always come-and-go as you please.</p>
        <p>We'll have stew available the entire evening, even at 4pm. So if you want to come at 4 and eat right away, that's great. If you want to come later and see a pumpkin come out of the oven, that magic will probably happen sometime after 6pm.</p>
        <p>We'll have a fire in the fire ring outside, so if the house is too full, wear some warm clothes so that you have the option to hangout outside.</p>
        <p>Extra things to know:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We'll provide stew, bread, and maybe some mulled cider</li>
            <li>If you feel inclined to bring something to share, bring your favorite fall food or beverage (fermented or otherwise)</li>
            <li>Feel free to invite a friend to take along</li>
            <li>Kids are definitely okay to take along</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>WHERE</h3>
        <p>At the Major Cannery.</p>
        <p><em>By Major Cannery, I mean our house. We do a lot of canning. The title seemed fitting.</em></p>
