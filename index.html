        <h3>WHEN</h3>
        <p>Sunday, November 8, 2015<br/>3:00pm - 9:00pm EST</p>

        <h3>WHAT</h3>
        <p>We make stew in some pumpkins every year and invite people to join us. It's always come-and-go as you please kind of event.</p>
        <p>We'll have stew available the almost the entire evening, probably starting at 4pm. So if you want to come at 4 and eat right away, then leave to get your kids to bed, that's great and totally acceptable. We get it.</p>
        <p>If you want to come later and see a pumpkin come out of the oven, filled with glorious stew, that magic will probably happen sometime after 6pm.</p>
        <p>We'll have a fire in the fire ring outside, so if the house is too full, wear some warm clothes so that you have the option to hangout outside.</p>
        <p>Extra things to know:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We'll provide stew, bread, and maybe some mulled cider</li>
            <li>If you feel inclined to bring something to share, bring your favorite fall food or beverage (fermented or otherwise)</li>
            <li>Feel free to invite a friend to take along</li>
            <li>Kids are definitely okay to take along</li>
        </ul>
